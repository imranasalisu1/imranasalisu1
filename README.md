- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @imranasalisu1
  Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Imrana Salisu, a Chemistry graduate turned data science enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights and solving problems through data. As a lifelong learner, I believe in the power of learning, relearning, and unlearning to stay ahead in an ever-evolving world.

My journey into data science has been fueled by curiosity and a desire to explore the endless possibilities that data offers. Iâ€™ve completed several transformative courses, including the Google Advanced Data Analytics program, where I gained hands-on experience in Python, statistics, linear regression, and machine learning. I also completed the IBM Data Science program, further solidifying my foundation in this exciting field.

Currently, Iâ€™m a fellow at the Arewa Data Science Academy, where Iâ€™m diving deeper into the world of data science. My focus is on mastering Python basics for data science, building a solid foundation before advancing into machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Collaboration and teamwork are at the heart of my approach. I am always open to working with like-minded individuals to achieve shared goals and create impactful solutions.

Letâ€™s connect and turn data into actionable insights! ðŸš€
